## The creation of simple GUIs usually involves 3 steps:
##
## * create the controls
## * layout the controls
## * propagate changes in a control to some output
##
## `GtkReactive` handles the first and third of these. Use Gtk.jl for layout.

using GtkReactive, Gtk.ShortNames, Colors

# Create some controls
n = slider(1:10)
dd = dropdown(["one"=>()->println("you picked \"one\""),
               "two"=>()->println("two for tea"),
               "three"=>()->println("three is a magic number")],
              label="dropdown")
cb = checkbox(true, label="make window visible")

# To illustrate some of Reactive's propagation, we create a textbox
# that shares the signal with the slider. You could alternatively
# `bind` the two signals together.
tb = textbox(Int; signal=n.signal)

# Set up the mapping for the dropdown callbacks
cbsig = map(g->g(), dd.mappedsignal)  # assign to variable to prevent garbage collection

# Lay out the GUI. You can alternatively use `glade` and pass the
# widgets to the constructors above (see the implementation of
# `player` in `extrawidgets.jl` for an example).
